* Add an option to make installing dependencies optional. Fix how dependencies are currently handled
  where if you select a subset of modules only a certain number will be installed. Need to use dfs
  or something like that.
* Add option for what to do when one command fails.
* Add ability to specify config file from command line and also load "tildeconfig.rb" by default
